# Custom Raspberry Pi Operating System

Welcome to the Custom Raspberry Pi OS project! This operating system is tailored for enhanced performance on Raspberry Pi devices, featuring optimized configurations, system tweaks, and safe overclocking to maximize hardware capabilities while ensuring stability.

## Features

- **Kernel Optimizations**: Customized Linux kernel streamlined for performance, with unnecessary drivers and modules removed.
- **Enhanced Performance**: System and network performance enhancements for smoother operation and better handling of intensive tasks.
- **Safe Overclocking**: Carefully adjusted clock speeds to improve performance without compromising system stability.

## Performance Enhancements

- **CPU and GPU Tuning**: Overclocking settings fine-tuned to boost processing power while maintaining thermal thresholds.
- **Memory Management**: Improved memory handling and reduced swap usage to enhance responsiveness.
- **I/O Performance**: Tweaks to filesystem and kernel parameters to optimize data throughput and reduce latency.

## Safety and Overclocking

### Overclocking Settings

- **CPU Frequency**: Set to 1.5 GHz from the default 1.2 GHz.
- **GPU Frequency**: Increased to 500 MHz to enhance graphical performance for media-rich applications.

### Cooling Recommendations

Overclocking increases the thermal output of the Raspberry Pi, which can lead to higher operating temperatures. To ensure stable operation and prevent thermal throttling or damage:

- **Active Cooling**: Use a dedicated cooling fan or case with built-in fans.
- **Passive Cooling**: Employ heatsinks on the CPU and GPU to dissipate heat effectively.
- **Adequate Ventilation**: Ensure the Raspberry Pi is in a well-ventilated area to prevent heat buildup.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the Custom Raspberry Pi OS on your device:

1. **Download the Image**: Navigate to the Releases section and download the latest version of the Custom Raspberry Pi OS image.
2. **Flash the Image**: Use software like Balena Etcher to flash the image to an SD card.
3. **Boot Your Raspberry Pi**: Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and connect the power supply.

## Usage and Configuration

Upon first boot, the system will perform initial setup tasks. You can configure network settings, user accounts, and other preferences via the command line interface or SSH.
